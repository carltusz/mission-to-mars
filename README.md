## Overview

In this project, Python was used with Splinter, Beautiful Soup and Pandas to gather and cleanse data from three websites. The data scraped included HTML tables, as well as links to images hosted by other websites.

This data was pushed to MongoDB to be stored as text in dictionaries. 

The data held in MondoDB was used to create a Flask app which presented recent images and news in a readable format, which was able to be refreshed by running the scraping.py script when the "Scrape New Data" button is pushed on the site.

Bootstrap 3 was used to ensure that the site was viewable on all devices, and all features of the site were consistently formatted and organized.
